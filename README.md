# Description
This template will create the directories and basic files needed to start a web project in C Sharp. I adapted it from Sayed I. Hashimi's [article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/02/how-to-create-your-own-templates-for-dotnet-new/). The directory structure and file contents are from Epicodus C Sharp curriculum and may not be suited for all projects.

The project files generated will have starter content as outlined in the Epicodus C Sharp course. The template will give relevant namespaces and paths for your project (i.e. TumbleweedBakehouse will be replaced everywhere with the name you give to your project - YourProjectName).

The directory/file structure created is:

## Installation Instructions
Clone the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/skillitzimberg/TumbleweedBakehouse.Solution).

While following this set up guide, replace both the brackets - [] - and the content between them with the information relevant to your situation. This is just an example guide.

Install the template using the command line interface (cli)/terminal:
* dotnet new --install [ /Users/Your/Path/Here ]/TumbleweedBakehouse.Solution

For example: When cloned to the Epicodus computer Desktop, the path would be /Users/Guest/Desktop/TumbleweedBakehouse.Solution.
The above command would then be:
* dotnet new --install /Users/Guest/Desktop/TumbleweedBakehouse.Solution

Navigate to the directory that you want your project to be in (i.e. Desktop, Documents, or wherever you keep your projects).

Run the this command in the cli/terminal:
* dotnet new tumbleweedbakehosue -n [ YourProjectName ] -o [ YourProjectName ].Solution

For example: If your project is called Banana the command would be:
* dotnet new tumbleweedbakehosue -n Banana -o Banana.Solution

Remove .git directory: run this command in YourProjectName.Solution directory.
* rm -rf .git

Be sure to git init again for a fresh start!

Open the directory in your text editor. Open the .template.config/template.json file and change the author name to your own. Read the article mentioned above for details on this file and how this template was created.
